# JS Small Apps

A collection of small apps and exercises implemented with Javascript.

## Description

I want to keep track of some small apps or exercises but I don't think they deserve their own repository. So, I decided to gather them inside this repo.

Most of the app ideas come from [@florinpop17's app-ideas repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).

## Preview
