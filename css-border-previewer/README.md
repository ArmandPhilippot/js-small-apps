# CSS Border Previewer

An app to preview how a shapes looks when you change CSS border properties.

You can find more details about the implementation here: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Border-Radius-Previewer.md but I have decided to not limit myself to border-radius.
