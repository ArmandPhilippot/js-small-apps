# Users list

An users list implementation using Javascript.

The implementation is inspired by the [CauseEffect app from @florinpop17 repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Cause-Effect-App.md).

However, I made small changes:

- Instead of hard coding the users objects, this implementation uses `fetch()` to retrieve data from an API.
- I implemented "routing": user info can be displayed if URL contains the user parameter.
